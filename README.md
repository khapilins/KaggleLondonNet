# KaggleLondonNet
Firtst my try in neural nets on https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn/ dataset

Simple net with sigmoid neurons and L2 reguralization. Main file is KaggleLondonNet.py. Nets themselves are net.py and net2.py
With current settings accuracy is about 90%

net2.py added as more flexible and adjustible net than the one in net.py. There's some different loss and activation functions and new ones can easily be adde. Also momentum technic was added there
