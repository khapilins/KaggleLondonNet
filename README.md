# KaggleLondonNet
Firtst my try in neural nets on https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn/ dataset

Simple net with sigmoid neurons and L2 reguralization. Main file is KaggleLondonNet.py
With current settings accuracy is about 90%

net2.py added as more flexible and adjustible net than the one in net.py. Also momentum technic was added there
